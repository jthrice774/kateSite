<p> I can help grow your business’s online presence and help the millions of health seekers achieve the best version of themselves. </p>
<p><b>How do I know I can do this?</b></p>
<p>I had my first taste of copywriting back in 2018 when I was asked to handle the social media pages for a franchise gym that I was a brand ambassador and trainer for. By gaining an online presence and voice, the business was able to </p><p><b><i style="text-transform:uppercase">triple its memberships within two months!</i></b></p>
<p>Since then, I have dabbled here and there in copywriting as a side hustle – providing guest blog content or helping out a friend with their business’s social media pages. I enjoyed what I was doing, typing away at the computer in what little free time I had between training clients, creating great content that was engaging for members and driving business, but never thought it could be a career choice.</p>
<p>After all, my focus was on obtaining my doctorate in Physical Therapy – I had been accepted and planned to start my courses in Fall of 2020. Then, as we all know, COVID happened. Both of my jobs as a Personal Trainer in a gym as well as an Exercise Specialist in a physical therapy clinic became obsolete with the new restrictions. I found myself drawn back to the keys of my laptop to continue my passion for helping people.</p>
<p>For the majority of 2020, I have dedicated myself to perfecting my skills for copywriting. I have completed AWAI’s Accelerated Course for Six Figure Copywriting, dove into the hidden world of SEO and Google Analytics, continue to take as many courses or webinars on anything and everything copywriting or relating to web content, and am a member of AWAI’s Professional Writers Alliance.</p>
